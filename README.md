# BallGame
Thanks to Elaine! She inspired me by her original ball game code. 
<p>I rewrote and enhanced her code to make GUI more customized and reasonable. 
<p>You can visit her website at: https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/28179980.
<p> My code focus on the specific speed, direction and color. As for GUI, I added buttons to control the balls movements.
